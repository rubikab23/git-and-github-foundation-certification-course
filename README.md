## Understanding Git

Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that tracks changes to files and coordinates work on those files among multiple people. It allows developers to maintain a history of changes, collaborate efficiently, and revert to previous states if needed.

## Exploring GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform built around Git. It provides hosting for Git repositories, tools for code review, issue tracking, and integration with various services. GitHub enhances collaboration by offering features like pull requests, wikis, and project management tools.

## Installing Git

To install Git on your system, follow these steps:

- **Windows**: Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and follow the installation instructions.
- **macOS**: Git comes pre-installed on macOS. You can also install it via Homebrew.
- **Linux**: Use your distribution's package manager (e.g., `apt-get` for Ubuntu) to install Git.

## Configuring Git

After installing Git, configure your username and email address using the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
